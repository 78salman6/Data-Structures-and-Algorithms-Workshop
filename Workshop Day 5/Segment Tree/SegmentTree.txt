Segment Tree is an advanced data structure which is used to do Range Queries and Many other things.

Notes-
* Segment Tree is a full binary tree.(Sorry for telling Complete Binary Tree :p).
* Segment Tree has a total of ((2*n)-1) nodes.
* Segment Tree is represented as an array in practice.
* Use upto 4*n space for array if n is the size of the array.
