Linear Search
Question
1.Find the missing number in an array
->Linear Approach
->Sum Approach
->XOR approach


What is search space?
The area of search under consideration.

What is Binary Search?
-> Divide and Conquer Approach
-> O(log2 n) time complexity?
Even if we had 1 billion elements binary search will still be able to find our key in at most 30 steps.
        At each step we divide the search space into two parts hence the name binary.
        
        For the given array 
        11 13 17 19 20 25 89
        0   1  2  3  4  5  6
        What is the search space here?
        Ans->
        
Where do we see binary search in general?
1.Searching in dictionary
2.Newton Raphson Method(Engineering Mathematics)


1.Monotonic function Invariants.
->Graph with min value k(increasing)
->graph with max value k(Decreasing)


2.Find the smallest positive missing number
->Binary Search


3.Search on prefix sum array
->linear approach
->Binary search(for queries)


4.Search in a sorted and Rotated Array
->linear approach
->binary Search
